# Control Systems Analysis and Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for fundamental control systems analysis and simulation problems.

The project focuses on time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of linear systems, including closed-loop modeling and dynamic system evaluation.

## Contents

- Step response analysis  
- Closed-loop transfer function computation  
- First-order system simulation  
- Frequency-domain analysis  

## Project Structure
